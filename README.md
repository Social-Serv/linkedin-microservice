Goal #1: obtain CV from LinkedIn, possibly requiring authorization
from a user.
     #2: sign-in with LinkedIn

Here is a list of what is possible to do with LinkedIn:
https://www.linkedin.com/developers/products
From these, I think the following can be useful:
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/talent/recruiter-system-connect
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/talent/apply-with-linkedin
- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/talent/easy-apply

We can't use them :(
These are enterprise features, and we are only a simple organization.
We can implement:
- Share
- Sign in
features. That's it.
